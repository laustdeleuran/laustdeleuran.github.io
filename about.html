	<h1>Wait! <br/>What is this? <br/>Who are you even?</h1>
	<p>Relax. Don't panic. It's just a website. It's actually <em>my website</em>. I’m Laust and I’m a UX designer &amp; front-end developer. So, just sit back and enjoy it. As much as you can enjoy a personal website, anyway.</p>
	<h2>Your website? You build these things?</h2>
	<p>Yes. I actually build websites for a living. I'm based in New York and I like to make stuff, especially when it's both effective and pretty. I've built websites since I was a mere 12 year old (back in 1997, when frames was still hot and <code class="type__blink">&lt;blink&gt;</code> was so cool).</p>
	<p>Now, I spend most of my time working for <a href="http://www.vertic.com" target="_blank">Vertic</a>, a digital advertising agency, where I do interaction design and front-end development. When I'm not working, I spend my time designing, sketching, coding half-finished web experiments and reading a lot of blog posts. Even though it's thoroughly nerdy I'm passionate about user interactions and code.</p>
	<p>You can check out some of my more nerdy stuff on <a href="http://github.com/laustdeleuran" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/user/laustdeleuran/" target="_blank">JS Fiddle</a> or <a href="http://codepen.io/laustdeleuran" target="_blank">Codepen</a>. Or if you're already sold, here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/laustdeleuran/5041786" target="_blank">my resume</a>.
