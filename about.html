<article class="article about">
	<h1>Wait! <br/>What is this? <br/>Who are you&nbsp;even?</h1>
	<p>Relax. Don't panic. It's just a website. It's actually <em>my website</em>. I’m Laust and I’m a UX designer &amp; front-end developer. So, just sit back and enjoy it. As much as you can enjoy a personal website, anyway.</p>
	<h2>Your website? You build these&nbsp;things?</h2>
	<p>Yes. I actually build websites for a living. I'm based in <del>New York</del> <del>Copenhagen</del> <del>Reno</del> Copenhagen and I like to make stuff, especially when it's both effective and pretty. I've built websites since I was a mere 12 year old (back in 1997, when frames was still hot and <code class="type__blink">&lt;blink&gt;</code> was so cool).</p>
	<p>Now, I spend most of my time <del>working for <a href="http://www.vertic.com" target="_blank">Vertic</a></del> <del><a href="http://www.1508.dk" target="_blank">1508</a></del> freelancing for amazing people who allows me to create awesome stuff, in the area of user experience design, prototyping and front-end development. When I'm not working, I spend my time designing, sketching, coding half-finished web experiments and reading a lot of blog posts. Even though it's thoroughly nerdy I'm passionate about user interactions and code.</p>
