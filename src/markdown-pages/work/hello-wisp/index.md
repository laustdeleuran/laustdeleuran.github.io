In my time as Lead Frontend Engineer at Wisp, I helped completely rebuild the frontend of their e-commerce website using React & Gatsby. By relentlessly focusing on performance metrics, we were able to consistently score in the 90th percentile on Google PageSpeed Insights.

Featuring a playful, personal, warm and inviting design on a extremely fast-loading website, we focused on serving Wisp's stated mission: to provide sexual health services to underserved communities.
