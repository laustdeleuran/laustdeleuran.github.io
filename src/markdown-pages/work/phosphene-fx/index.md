Phosphene is a New York-based independent design and visual effects studio, creating effects for well-known shows such as Boardwalk Empire, True Detective and large feature films such as Bourne Legacy, The Fault In Our Stars and Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close.

While at [Koalition](https://www.koalition.com), and in close collaboration with [Norgram](https://www.norgram.co/), I built Phosphene's new website and designed the animations for the entire site.
