The Scandinavian Design College is a boarding school focusing on readying its students for any of the many design-oriented degrees available in the Danish college system.

Together with NorgramÂ®, Koalition designed and built a website that reflects the values of modern design while also allowing potential students to read about the different tracks and apply to attend.

I built all technical aspects of the website using `react` and Wordpress. The scribbly hover animations were created using 2D `canvas`.
