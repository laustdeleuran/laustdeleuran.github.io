[Koalition](https://www.koalition.com) teamed up with Eko and the world's largest food network, BuzzFeed Tasty, to bring the power of choice to the kitchen. With 320 possible recipes in 10 minutes of video, there are a vast amount of possible playthroughs.

With other developers at Koalition I built the interactive interface for Tasty in the `eko` framework, working closely with developers at Eko as well.
