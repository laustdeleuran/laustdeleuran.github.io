Q is the First Genderless Voice, created to end gender bias in AI assistants. Technology companies often choose to gender technology believing it will make people more comfortable adopting it. Unfortunately this reinforces a binary perception of gender, and perpetuates stereotypes that many have fought hard to progress.

I created the animation and interactions of the amorphous Q bubble using 2D `canvas` and developed the site to host it.

The project was created in close close cooperation with Copenhagen Pride, Virtue, Equal AI, & thirtysoundsgood while I worked at [Koalition](https://www.koalition.com).
