**Hus Forbi** (literally Home Passed By) is a NGO working with the homeless population in Denmark. They provide clothes and supplies for the homeless, but their core responsibility is writing and publishing the monthly magazine **Hus Forbi**.

Built with `angular` and Wordpress, the site showcases the people who sell the magazine, and benefits from the profits directly. Design by [Magic People Voodoo People](https://magicpeoplevoodoopeople.com/).
