Boulder Care offers telehealth addiction treatment grounded in kindness, respect, and unconditional support. Their mission is to improve the lives of people with substance use disorders. We provide the medication, resources, and support to help our patients succeed on their own terms, wherever they are in their journey.

Working at Boulder, I've felt extremely lucky to contribute to this mission alongside a highly motivated and talented team. I lead a team of focused engineers in a creative and highly adaptive environment where we focus on delivering value as quickly and efficiently as we can.
