Sixty one percent of millennials use Facebook as their main source of news - but Facebook is an echo chamber, or filter bubble, that prevents us from being confronted with news and opinions we don't agree with.

In order to balance out the bias in our Facebook feed we need to like pages and people that we donâ€™t agree with - or possibly hate.

Facebook is the primary news source for millennials. That fact inspired Vice to create the campaign #likewhatyouhate. While at [Koalition](https://www.koalition.com) I build this campaign site for Vice. The campaign focuses on making our Facebook feeds more balanced. It exposes us to a more nuanced feed by breaking us out of our little echo chambers.
