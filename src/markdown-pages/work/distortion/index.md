Danish street festival Distortion is a half week long festival celebrating electronic music and Copenhagen nightlife.

With an estimated 100.000 guests per day, it is one of the largest annual gatherings in Europe.

From 2016 to 2019, I built Distortion's website while working for [Koalition](https://www.koalition.com) using `react` and Wordpress.
