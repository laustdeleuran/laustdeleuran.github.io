	<p>I've worked on a lot of exciting projects for many different clients, from big corporations to small and local businesses. I love it all, as long as it provides a challenge!</p>
	<p>Here's a few samples, but if you want to know more, don't hesitate to <a href="/about-laust-johan-deleuran/#get-in-touch">let me know</a>:</p>

					<p>Berlingske Media is one of the oldest and largest media agencies in Denmark. Originating in the newspaper business, Berlingske Media has a long history of producing journalism in a lot of different forms. One of their more recent products is a telegram service catering to large businesses and policy makers. The app delivers raw news as they emerge, often before the news hit mainstream media. The app also allows users to subscribe to subjects they find more interesting through push-notifications and allows berlingske to change the apps substructure as new journalistic themes emerge.</p>
					<p>To create a cohesive experience across a very diverse landscape of devices, the app was created using modern web technologies and packaged to four major device manufacturers.</p>

					<p>Forca handles the digital aspects of some of Denmarks largest retirement funds - PBU, LP and PKA. Magnetix had been working on a new web presence for these three retirement funds and asked my help to finish the project, focusing on user interactions and helpful animations to make the final product shine it's best.</p>
					<p>Together with the talented team at Forca and Magnetix, I helped create better interactions for end users and clean up the interface. We also focused on making the final product as flawless as possible, fixing a lot of minor code and design bugs, and creating a faster front-end development process for the team moving forward.</p>

					<p>One of the best known festivals in Europe, Roskilde Festival wanted to work with Umwelt to create their new corporate site. I became a part of the core development team, working in tight cooperation with sa small task force at Umwelt.</p>
					<p>Roskilde Festival is an exciting brand, and as such they needed a modern and versatile website. Working through several iterations of the design, we developed the site in AngularJS with several integrations to other services, from CMS data from Umbraco, to favorite artist selction through Facebook Connect and an on-site music player integrating streaming music from Soundcloud.</p>
					<p>The site is fully responsive, and apapts seamlessly across screen sizes.</p>

				<div class="project__desc">
					<p>Also for Umwelt, I've helped create a small new component for Danish newspaper Politiken. The component is a quiz (run by and with questions from the well-known game <a href="http://bezzerwizzer.dk/" target="_blank">Bezzerwizzer</a>. Users can participate in the quiz of the day as well as revisit earlier quizzes. Users logged in to the newspaper can also track their own statistics. The component works cross device and is fully fluid, even though Politiken's current uses an adaptive approach to serve different sites for desktop and mobile. This way, Politiken can reuse the same component across their platforms. </p>
					<p>The solution is built with AngularJS. All logic is done on the front-end as all data is provided through a simple REST API.</p>

					<p>Umwelt approached me with a small project for Danish insurance giant Falck. The campaign site is a small cross-device quiz, determining your type &ndash; a dare to help figure out how daring you are. The campaign targets new customers in Denmark.</p>
					<p>The solution is built with AngularJS and uses CSS transitions to help people quickly navigate the simple site, and give a visual depth to certain design elements.</p>

					<p>During my time at 1508, I helped AARCH create their new corporate site, with a high focus on aesthetics and social appeal within the target group.</p>
					<p>We created a very flexible framework to fit the content needs of a large public education facility, and with a strong communication channel through <em>magazines.</em></p>

					<p>One of the most challenging projects I've ever been a part of, was at 1508. We were asked to reenvision how online banking works for consumers &ndash; focussing on mobile devices.</p>
					<p>The task was to create an entirely new experience that would leverage the available banking data to help consumers come to better grips with their banking affairs.</p>
					<p>We attacked the task in a very agile manner, with short sprints to test new interaction patterns and UX ideas through a rapidly updated prototype.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, I'm not able to share any visuals from this project.</p>
