	<p>I've worked on a lot of exciting projects for many different clients, from big corporations to small and local businesses. I love it all, as long as it provides a challenge!</p>
	<p>Here's a few samples:</p>

					<p>During my time at 1508, I helped AARCH create their new corporate site, with a high focus on aesthetics and social appeal within the target group.</p>
					<p>We created a very flexible framework to fit the content needs of a large public education facility, and with a strong communication channel through <em>magazines.</em></p>

					<p>One of the most challenging projects I've ever been a part of, was at 1508. We were asked to reenvision how online banking works for consumers &ndash; focussing on mobile devices.</p>
					<p>The task was to create an entirely new experience that would leverage the available banking data to help consumers come to better grips with their banking affairs.</p>
					<p>We attacked the task in a very agile manner, with short sprints to test new interaction patterns and UX ideas through a rapidly updated prototype.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, I'm not able to share any visuals from this project.</p>

					<p>My last project while working for Vertic, I helped create the newest iteration of their corporate website. Although I left before development was finalized, I developed the core front-end architecture and the central interaction design.</p>
					<p>We focused strongly on the finish and details of the site, allowing for rich interactions and a strong mental model, that guides the user through the site content.</p>
					<p>I was responsible for <em>User Experience Design</em> and <em>Front-end Development</em>.</p>

					<p>Also during my time at Vertic, I helped Siemens develop an interactive, immersive 3D world in HTML5. The solution worked cross platform, and was adapted to both huge touch-screens, tablets and desktop computers.</p>
					<p>The site allowed Siemens sales people to showcase drive systems in realistic settings and show customization options on the spot. </p>
